# TimeSeries FCO2018

This repository contains data and the code used to explore, analyze and forecast
passengers traffic data in the period 2004 - 2018

- dati_fc02004.csv contains the data of the total passengers traffic (one point a month)
  -- the file has been produced using the web scraper scrapeFCOpsg.py

I have analyzed the data using many of the classical techniques for Time Series Analysis:
- raw data plot
- autocorrelation plot
- decomposition (Trend, Stagional, Noise)
- explicit Seasonal component modeling

I have applied to these data SARIMA models for forecasting
